    tables:
      - name: charges 
        description: >
          A charge for a workspace is generated at the beginning of a subscription_period, 
          based on the number of users in the workspace and the pricing plan of the subscription. 
          The charge_month field is the first day of the month in which the corresponding subscription_period started. 
          For example, a subscription_period starting on 2020-12-31 and ending on 2021-01-30 would have charge_month = 2020-12-01

      - name: ga_sessions 
        description: >
          An anonymized sample of user sessions collected by Google Analytics on visitors to the Toggl Track public website. 
          The user_id field corresponds to the internal Toggl Track user ID. 
          These sessions have already been backstitched, meaning that once a user has signed-up, 
          the user_id field on all past and future sessions belonging to the same user 
          (as determined by the Google Analytics internal user ID) is populated with their Toggl Track user ID. 
          A session with a null user_id corresponds to a visitor that has not signed up for Toggl Track

      - name: pricing_plans 
        description: >
          Indicate whether a subscription is starter or premium and monthly or annual. 
          Annual plans are prepaid for 12 months, but still generate a charge every month 
          that is subtracted from a pre-paid balance. In this way, charges represent the periodized monthly 
          revenue of both annual and monthly plans.

      - name: subscription_periods 
        description: >
          A subscription period is a 30-day interval of a paid subscription. 
          Subscriptions apply to workspaces, not users. 
          Every workspace starts its first subscription with a special trial subscription_period 
          in which no charge is generated. Trial periods can occur only once per workspace. 
          For a subscription in progress, finished_on is null.

      - name: userss 
        description: >
          A user is an account / profile on Toggl Track. 1 user = 1 email address. 
          At signup, a user gets an autogenerated workspace, of which they are the workspace owner. 
          A user can create or join many workspaces and invite many other users to join their workspace(s).

      - name: workspaces 
        description: >
          Workspaces are collections of 1 or more users. Every workspace has exactly 1 user that is the workspace owner
